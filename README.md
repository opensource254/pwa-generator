# PWA Generator

> Quickly and easily generate the core components of a Progressive Web App (PWA) to enhance your web applications.

Live Demo: [https://pwagenerator.netlify.app](https://pwagenerator.netlify.app)

**Target Users:** This tool is designed for developers of all levels, from beginners looking to get started with PWAs to experienced developers seeking a quick scaffolding solution.

**Limitations:** Currently, this tool focuses on generating basic manifest and service worker files. More advanced features are planned for future releases.

## Features

Here's a breakdown of the current and planned features:

- **Generate Manifest:** Creates a fundamental `manifest.json` file, defining essential app metadata such as name, icons (placeholder support), display mode, and start URL. This provides the basic information needed for your PWA to be installable.
- **Generate Service Worker:** Generates a basic service worker script (`service-worker.js`) to enable offline caching and handle basic fetch events. This lays the groundwork for offline functionality and future enhancements like push notifications.
- **Generate Icons:** Coming soon! This feature will empower you to effortlessly generate app icons in various sizes and formats, ensuring optimal display across different devices and platforms.
- **Offline Support:** Under development! This will enhance the service worker functionality to provide robust offline access to your web application's core content and assets.
- **IndexedDB Integration:** Planned for future updates. This will enable your PWA to store structured data locally on the user's device, enabling richer offline experiences and data persistence.
- **Push Notifications:** On the roadmap! This exciting feature will allow you to engage users with timely updates and notifications, even when they're not actively using your PWA.

4.  Integrate these files into your web application.

## Contributing

We are planning to open-source this project in the near future. We welcome contributions from the community! Stay tuned for more information on how you can get involved.

## Roadmap

We are continuously working to improve the PWA Generator. Here's a glimpse of what's on our roadmap:

- More comprehensive manifest options (e.g., background color, theme color, related applications).
- Advanced service worker features (e.g., precaching, background sync, push notifications).
- Improved UI/UX for a more seamless user experience.
- More detailed documentation and examples.
